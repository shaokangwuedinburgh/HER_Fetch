the push experiments were failed. Its performance does not improve

I guess there are several reasons account for the the failure:

1. For the evalution part. I only use the success rate of 10 episodes to determine the adaptive noise. But in another experiment without adaptive noise, the experiment also fails. Why?

	can I solve it by adding MPI to it? or adding norm method to it?
